## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I've been struggling with div's positioning for a while, however, today I discover the flow-grow property, which would have saved me un past ocations if I've known it before! In order to position my flex div at the bottom of the card, I used this property in the .info div and used margin-top: auto in my element in order to place them at the bottom of the card. Thi helped me lots!
